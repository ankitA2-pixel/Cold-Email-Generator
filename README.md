# Cold-Email-Generator
Developed an end-to-end AI-powered cold email generator that utilizes an open-source LLM (Llama 3.1) along with LangChain and ChromaDB to create personalized cold emails for potential clients. 
It extracts relevant data, such as job postings on a company’s career pages, and a vector database is employed for
personalization purposes for each email sent.
Wrapped the model and generation logic inside an interactive web UI via Streamlit, which makes this tool usable for
actual sales/business development activities.
